# MIPS Processor

To whom this may concern,

In this folder you will find a project of mine from when I was studying at UC Irvine. This project was to recreate a MIPS Processor using Verilog to practice using the language and gain experience designing and simulating hardware components within Cadence software.

Within the folder, you will find:  
* "mips_32" folder containing the source files of the hardware components along with the main file "mips_32.v" connecting them altogether to simulate a functioning MIPS Processor with Data Hazard protection.

* a high-level overview of the datapath for the MIPS Processor
